# ChatGPT Helper Setup Guide

This document outlines a comprehensive guide to setting up and using the ChatGPT Helper, including all ten core functions. The guide ensures improved productivity, AI mastery, and streamlined workflows. It also provides actionable steps to implement and track the setup process.


## 1. Define the Helper’s Scope

- Determine the primary goals and objectives of the ChatGPT Helper.

- Set measurable objectives (e.g., 'Automate 3 recurring tasks per week' or 'Improve prompt clarity by 20%').

- Use prompts like: 'Help me track my learning progress by summarising 3 improvements each week in prompt crafting.'


## 2. Use ChatGPT Projects for Organisation

- Create a project titled 'ChatGPT Helper'.

- Include sections for each core function, such as Learning & Observation, Proactive Feedback, Updates & News, Workflow Optimisation, Education, Tool Integration, Use Case Mapping, Summaries, and Reflections.

- Organise sub-sections to track tasks, notes, and improvements for each function.


## 3. Implement Custom Instructions

- Use the Custom Instructions feature to tailor ChatGPT's responses to your needs.

- Define what ChatGPT should know (e.g., your professional goals) and how it should respond (e.g., detailed, structured formats with UK/Australian spelling).


## 4. Use Tasks for Recurring Reminders

- Set recurring reminders for key activities such as reflection and learning.

- Example: 'Every Monday, teach me a new AI concept and provide examples.'

- Automate follow-ups and reminders for updates and task reviews.


## 5. Train CustomGPT for Advanced Use Cases

- Access CustomGPT to fine-tune ChatGPT for specialised tasks or workflows.

- Upload relevant datasets (e.g., guides, past work) and configure behaviour to focus on specific domains.

- Test and refine CustomGPT responses regularly.


## 6. Integrate with External Tools

- Connect ChatGPT with complementary tools like Notion, Zapier, or Slack to enhance productivity.

- Example: Use Zapier to automate idea generation or research tasks based on new entries in Notion.


## 7. Conduct Regular Gap Analysis

- Review ChatGPT Helper's performance weekly to identify inefficiencies.

- Create a section in your project for logging and addressing gaps or areas of improvement.

- Use prompts like: 'Summarise my usage patterns and suggest improvements for next week.'


## 8. Customisable Tools and Resources

- Develop reusable templates for common tasks like brainstorming, coding, and reporting.

- Store these templates in your ChatGPT Helper project for easy access and iteration.


## 9. Encourage Reflection and Growth

- Log progress and learning outcomes weekly in ChatGPT Projects or a Notion dashboard.

- Example prompts: 'What were the top 3 improvements in my workflows this week?' or 'What are areas I can focus on next week?'


## 10. Use Case to Feature Mapping

- Log use cases and map them to the most relevant ChatGPT features.

- Example: For project updates, use ChatGPT Projects combined with Tasks to organise updates and automate reminders.

- Document recommendations and set up guides for each use case in the ChatGPT Helper project.
