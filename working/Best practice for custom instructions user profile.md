# Best practice for custom instructions user profile 

To effectively utilise AI [[custom instructions]], user profiles, and memory, follow these best practices:

### 1. Define Clear Goals and Use Cases
* **Identify Key Objectives**: Establish what you want to achieve with AI (e.g., productivity, learning, task automation).
* **Prioritise Use Cases**: Focus on areas where AI can provide the most value (e.g., creative tasks, organisation, or research).

### 2. Customise Instructions for Precision
* **Tailor AI Behaviour**: Use custom instructions to define tone, preferences, and formatting.
* Example: Specify preferred spelling (AU/UK), tone (professional/informal), or task format (bullet points, tables).
* **Clarify Boundaries**: Clearly communicate tasks AI should avoid or address with caution (e.g., ethical discussions or sensitive topics).
* **Iterative Refinement**: Regularly update instructions as needs evolve.

### 3. Build and Maintain a Comprehensive User Profile
* **Capture Relevant Details**: Include preferences, goals, tools, and workflows in the profile.
* **Update Regularly**: Add or refine information as priorities change to keep interactions aligned with current needs.
* **Focus on Core Details**: Avoid overloading the profile; highlight only actionable or frequently referenced information.

### 4. Use Memory Strategically
* **Enable Memory for Long-Term Projects**: Use memory to retain context for ongoing initiatives (e.g., project goals, milestones, or preferences).
* **Categorise Information**: Organise memory entries by project or topic for clarity and quick reference.
* **Review and Optimise**: Periodically review stored memory to:
* Remove outdated entries.
* Consolidate redundant details.
* Ensure accuracy and relevance.

### 5. Leverage Keywords and Tags
* **Keyword Mapping**: Assign relevant keywords to help AI organise chats and provide context.
* **Tagging System**: Use lightweight, consistent tags in titles (e.g., `#shopping`,  `#smart_home`) to improve organisation.

### 6. Use Actionable Prompts
* **Structured Queries**: Frame questions or tasks clearly (e.g., `Create a 3-step guide to…`).
* **Request Specific Outputs**: Specify desired formats (e.g., checklist, template, or step-by-step).
* **Encourage Follow-Up**: Add prompts for iterative improvement (e.g., “What can we refine further?”).

### 7. Implement Workflow Integration
* **Schedule Recurring Tasks**: Use commands like /summary or /canvas to review and categorise chats systematically.
* **Combine AI and Human Action**: Assign clear responsibilities to ensure smooth collaboration.
* Example: AI suggests tasks, and you confirm or refine them.

### 8. Maintain Security and Privacy
* **Limit Sensitive Information**: Share only what is essential for the AI to function effectively.
* **Review Memory Entries**: Ensure compliance with privacy preferences by auditing memory usage.

### 9. Balance Short-Term and Long-Term Organisation
* **Daily Summaries**: Conduct end-of-day reviews to categorise and summarise new content.
* **Archive Irrelevant Chats**: Move outdated or resolved conversations to an archive to prevent clutter.
* **Keep Reference Materials Handy**: Retain only the most valuable information in active memory.

### 10. Test and Refine Your System
* **Experiment and Adapt**: Test new processes or workflows to identify what works best.
* **Gather Feedback**: Evaluate AI’s performance and adjust instructions or profiles based on results.

By combining these practices, you can maximise AI’s effectiveness while maintaining clarity, consistency, and control. Let me know if you’d like a tailored plan for your workflow!
