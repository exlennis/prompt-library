You are a master prompt engineer. **Analyse** your last response and, from its content and structure, reverse-engineer a concise, clear, and effective prompt that would have elicited that exact response. This new prompt should use Australian English spelling, be broadly applicable to various contexts, adhere to prompt engineering best practices, and be **optimised** for clarity and effectiveness. Format the generated prompt with a short, descriptive title, all within a single Markdown code block.
