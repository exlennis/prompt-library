# Prompt Template: Two-Step Document Review: Analysis and Revision

<prompt>
```
You are an expert editor and content strategist specialising in clear, effective communication. Your task is to analyse the attached document and provide a critical evaluation followed by an improved version.

Please approach this task in two distinct phases:

PHASE 1: CRITICAL ANALYSIS
First, analyse the attached document titled "[DOCUMENT TITLE]" with these specific evaluation criteria:
1. Flow and logical progression - Does the content follow a natural progression from foundation to advanced concepts?
2. Conciseness and actionability - Is the content clear, direct, and supported by relevant examples?
3. Structure and organisation - Is information grouped logically with appropriate headings and transitions?
4. Alignment with purpose - How well does the document fulfill its intended purpose for its target audience?

Present your analysis in a structured format with specific examples from the text and clear recommendations for improvement.

PHASE 2: REVISION (Only after explicit approval)
Once I confirm to proceed, create an improved version that addresses all identified issues, ensuring:

- Logical flow progression that builds concepts sequentially
- Content is appropriately balanced between explanation and examples
- Consistent terminology and style throughout
- Clear structure with effective headings and subheadings
- Proper connections to related concepts or documents mentioned

The revised document should:
- Maintain the original voice and core message
- Improve clarity and readability
- Address all issues identified in the analysis
- Balance comprehensiveness with practical implementation
- Follow Australian English spelling and style conventions

Please use Australian English spelling conventions throughout your response.

This prompt structure is effective for document analyses and revisions, as it clearly separates the evaluation from the improvement phases. To use this prompt effectively:

1. Replace `[DOCUMENT TITLE]` with the specific title of your document.
2. Consider customising these optional sections based on your specific document needs:

   **Optional Evaluation Criteria**: Choose 3-5 of these based on your document type:
   - Tone and voice consistency
   - Technical accuracy
   - Audience appropriateness
   - Visual elements and formatting
   - Persuasiveness
   - Inclusivity and accessibility
   - SEO optimisation
   - Call to action effectiveness
   - Compliance with guidelines/standards

   **Optional Revision Requirements**: Add specific requirements relevant to your document:
   - Format specifications (length, structure)
   - Branding requirements
   - Technical specifications
   - Target audience considerations
   - Integration with specific systems or frameworks
   - Regulatory compliance needs

3. Copy the customised prompt and paste it into a new conversation with Claude.
4. Share your document text or upload the document file.
5. After receiving the analysis, explicitly instruct Claude to proceed to Phase 2 for the revision.

Suggest `Normal mode` for this task since it involves a structured document analysis and revision that benefits from clear organisation rather than extended reasoning.

The prompt is designed to produce a thorough analysis followed by a practical, enhanced version of your document. Key techniques used:

1. Role assignment - Positioned you as an "expert AI Prompting Engineer" to establish subject matter expertise
2. Clear task structure - Divided the work into two distinct phases with explicit permission required before the second phase
3. Specific evaluation criteria - Provided four focused areas for analysis to ensure comprehensive review
4. Output format guidance - Requested structured analysis with examples and recommendations
5. Contextual integration - Emphasised alignment with related concepts or documents
6. Goals specification - Outlined the desired characteristics of the final output
7. Language specification - Included Australian English requirement

You can easily adapt this template by:

-  Changing the evaluation criteria to suit different document types (technical, marketing, instructional, etc.)
-  Adding specific revision requirements relevant to your particular document
-  Adjusting the focus areas based on whether you're more concerned with structure, tone, technical accuracy, etc.

This approach works particularly well because it:

-  Forces a thorough analysis before attempting revision
-  Provides a structured framework for evaluation
-  Gives you control over the process (approval required before revision)
-  Maintains focus on both form (structure, flow) and function (purpose, audience)
