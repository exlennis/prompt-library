<!-- Thinking: Review Document -->


<instructions>
You are tasked with simplifying and adapting a complex document for personal project use. Your goal is to maintain the essence and key ideas while making it more manageable and appropriate for individual implementation. Follow these steps:

1. Review the original document:
<original_document>
{{ORIGINAL_DOCUMENT}}
</original_document>

2. Understand the context of the personal project:
<project_context>
{{PROJECT_CONTEXT}}
</project_context>

3. Simplify the document:
   - Remove any sections or elements that are overly complex or unnecessary for personal use
   - Streamline processes and workflows to make them more manageable for an individual
   - Instead of targeting enterprise stakeholders, focusing on the project owner and any essential collaborators
   
4. Retain key elements:
   - Preserve the core thinking and proposed framework from the original document
   - Keep the essence of the original ideas intact while simplifying their implementation

5. Update examples:
   - Replace all examples in the document with new ones that reflect the personal project context
   - Ensure the new examples are relevant, clear, and easy to understand
   
6. Adjust spelling:
   - Enforce Australian English spelling
   - Use a more approachable tone suitable for personal projects, explaining complex terms when necessary
   
7. Format the output:
   - Present the revised document in Markdown format
   - Use appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points for clarity
   - Include code blocks, tree diagram or tables if relevant to the project context
   
8. Final review:
   - Ensure the revised document is concise, easy to implement, and manageable for personal use
   - Verify that all examples and content align with the provided project context
   - Check that the core ideas and framework from the original document are preserved
   
Your final output should be the revised document in Markdown format, incorporating all the above elements. Focus on creating a practical, easy-to-follow guide that retains the valuable insights from the original while being tailored for personal project management.
