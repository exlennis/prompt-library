## Current Projects
- Smart Home (Bosisto) Automation
- Shopping Research
- LLMs and Prompt Engineering
- Learning Coding, CLI, and scripting 
- **FOMO (File Organisation, Management, & Optimisation)**

## Capstone Project: FOMO 
- Consolidate and centralise file management across devices and locations.
- Automate processes (rename, optimise, sort).
- Ensure accessibility and an easy-to-use and maintain system. 
   
### Implementation Plan (6 steps) & structure 
1. Tech Stack Optimization
2. System Audit & Analysis
3. Sync Conflict Resolution
4. File System Optimization
5. Workflow & Automation Design
6. Backup & Storage Strategy

### File Management & Organization
- **Goal:** Simplify file management and reduce complexity.
- **Cloud Storage Sync:** Documents and Desktop folders synced via iCloud.


### Tagging System
- **Goal:** Implement a unified tagging across all systems across Finder (maining file system sync via iCloud ), Apple Notes, Reminders, Mail, and Password Manager.
- **Focus:** Cross-app tag standardization and Smart Folder/automation integration using tags and Smart Folders over traditional folder structures in Apple Notes.
- **Strategy**: Gradually phase out existing folders while maintaining accessibility through dynamic filtering.
- **Initial tags for a simplified system**: 5+3 core tag system across all touch-points.
   - `#todo`
   - `#archive`
   - `#reference` (includes FOMO-related notes)
   - `#personal`
   - `#work`
   - `#family` &  `#finance`
   - `#project`  TBC
   - `#media`  TBC
   - `#system` or `#admin`  TBC

### App Management

Moving away from proprietary software to platform-native or open-source options that prioritise automation, integration, and privacy.

- **Objective:** Streamline applications, eliminate redundancies, and optimise resource usage.

**Key Features:**
- **Automation and Integrated Workflow:** Enable agents to perform operations, such as monitoring key folders, flagging unused applications, and sending review notification reminders for unused applications.
- **Streamlined Process:** Review all app categories simultaneously before cleanup. Aim for automatic recommendations for all app categories without prompting.



### Software & Tool Preferences

- **Version Control:** Prefers structured version control (e.g., "v2", "v1.1", "(Updated: YYYY-MM-DD)"). Avoids subjective terms.
- **Code Editor:** Prefers Zed (lightweight, clean design) with AI integration similar to VS Code's Copilot. Exploring VS Code. Balance between AI features and minimalist design is crucial.
- **PDF Handling:** Prefers OCR-based renaming for PDFs.
- **Naming Conventions:** Prefers research-based justification.
- **Video Processing:** Cautious about automation; prefers manual review of a small sample before full implementation.
- **AI Tagging:** Exploring cost-effective solutions.
