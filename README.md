# prompt-library

Welcome to my collection of prompts for various AI tasks!

- Goal: Create a repository that stores reusable prompt templates.
- Content: Each prompt should include a title, category, detailed instructions, roles (e.g., system, user), tone/style guidelines, example usage, and any metadata (such as creation date or tags).
- Linking: Some prompts might reference or build on others. You might want to include links (or “see also” sections) so users can navigate between related templates.
- Automation: Later you can add simple scripts (e.g., Python with the OpenAI API) to help parse or update metadata automatically.

**Categories:**

- [AI Writing](/categories/ai-writing/)
- [Coding](/categories/coding/)
- [General](/categories/general/)
- ... (list all your categories with links)

**How to Use:**

1.  Browse the [categories](/categories/) folder.
2.  Find prompts that are relevant to you.
3.  Copy the "Prompt" section and paste it into your AI tool of choice.
